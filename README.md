# Hi, I'm Abhay 👋

I’m a computer engineering student who enjoys turning messy data into clean, reliable systems.  
I like pipelines that don’t break, queries that make sense, and learning things from first principles.

---

## 🧭 About me
- Curious about **data engineering**, backend systems, and how data moves at scale  
- Believe good data > fancy dashboards  
- Prefer understanding *why* something works, not just *how*

---

## 🧱 What I work with
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, Java (learning deeper every day)
- **Data:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Analytics:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Backend:** Flask (basics → building blocks)
- **Tools:** Git, Docker

---

## 🏗️ Currently building
- Resume-ready **data + backend projects**
- Foundations of **data engineering** (ETL, schemas, pipelines)


---

## 🧠 How I think about data
- Data should be **trustworthy before it’s pretty**
- Pipelines should fail **loudly, not silently**
- Automation is respect for future-you

---

## 📌 Goals for 2026
- Build at least **3 end-to-end data projects**
- Get comfortable with **distributed data concepts**
- Contribute to **open-source**, even in small ways

---

## 🎯 Fun facts
- I enjoy debugging ETL bugs more than writing UI
- I like projects that run quietly for months without breaking
- Documentation is underrated and I stand by that
